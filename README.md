App is built with kotlin and hence requires that the Kotlin plugin is installed in Android Studio to run.

Newer versions of Android Studio might notify you to install the kotlin plugin when attempting to build the project, but if that doesn't happen, it can be setup manually.

To do this, navigate to Preferences > Plugins > Browse Repositories, search for Kotlin, and click Install.

When the install is complete, you will need to restart Android Studio to apply the new plugin.
